This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy’s food delivery dataset to uncover patterns in customer preferences, restaurant performance, and delivery efficiency.

Through extensive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, I explored:

- Ordering trends by city, cuisine, and price range

- Delivery time distribution and factors influencing it

- Restaurant ratings and customer satisfaction trends

- Peak order times and cost–rating correlations



### Project Overview



The Swiggy Food Delivery Analysis project focuses on exploring food delivery trends, customer behavior, and restaurant performance through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset was cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to uncover insights into delivery efficiency, customer ratings, and order patterns across cities and cuisines.



### Key Insights:



- High-rated restaurants maintain shorter average delivery times.

- Peak orders occur during weekends and dinner hours.

- Mid-priced restaurants gain the highest repeat customer rate.

- Cuisines like North Indian and Chinese dominate urban demand.



### Project Outcome:



 This analysis helped identify key factors that influence delivery time, customer satisfaction, and restaurant ratings. Insights like peak-hour demand and delivery optimization can be used by food delivery platforms to enhance service efficiency and improve user experience.
